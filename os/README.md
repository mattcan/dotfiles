# Profile Creation

Profiles here are set as symbolic links to `$HOME\.zprofile` based on your
choice during setup. Profiles differ from the `thispc` file in that you
will want to add machine specific things required at boot (eg starting
`ssh-agent` in cygwin) or things you don't mind being public.
